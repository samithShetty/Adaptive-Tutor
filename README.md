# Getting Started with the Adaptive Tutor

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts to Run
To host the frontend, you will need to run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

To host the backend, you will need to cd into the backend folder and install all of the python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
It is recommended that you use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this, though technically this is optional.

once these dependencies are installed, once again from the backend database you can run:

### `Flask run`

This will run the backend on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You can directly access your api endpoints this way.
